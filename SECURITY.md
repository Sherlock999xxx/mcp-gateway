# Security Policy

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability, please report it privately.

Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories (private vulnerability reporting) for this repository.

If private reporting is not available yet, open a GitHub issue with minimal details and mark it clearly as a security report. We will coordinate a safer channel for the full details.
