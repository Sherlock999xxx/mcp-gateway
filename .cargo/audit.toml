# RUSTSEC-2023-0071 affects *private-key* RSA operations via non-constant-time behavior.
# In this repo, `rsa` is a dev-dependency used only for ephemeral test-key generation
# in integration tests (not in the gateway runtime). The advisory currently has no
# patched release; we track it here so audits stay actionable.
