#
# Docs-derived example probe: show what happens when openapiProbe=true
# and the spec's server URL is unreachable (no baseUrl override).
#
# The OpenAPI spec used here declares:
#   servers: [{ url: http://example.invalid }]
#
# If the adapter probes that URL at startup, it should fail to start unless
# openapiProbe is disabled or baseUrl is overridden to a reachable host.
#

adapter:
  bind: 127.0.0.1:19087
  logLevel: info
  # rely on default openapiProbe=true (per docs) to test probe behavior
